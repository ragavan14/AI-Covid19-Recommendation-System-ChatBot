# **AI-Covid19-Recommendation-System-ChatBot**
## About the Project : ##
  With the spread of ***COVID-19 across the world***, there is a sense of panic and uncertainty amongst the public. ***People are not sure what measures to take to safeguard themselves and their family and have many questions.***

  During the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, institutions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have begun utilizing chatbots to share information, suggest behavior, and offer emotional support. Chatbots are software programs that talk with people through voice or text in their natural language. Some well-known examples include “Alexa” from Amazon, “Siri” from Apple, and “Cortana” from Microsoft. They often come pre-installed on smartphones or home-based smart speakers.
  
  In recent years, chatbot use for health-related purposes has increased considerably, from supporting clinicians with clinical interviews and diagnosis to aiding consumers in self managing chronic conditions. Chatbots have varied widely in their responses to questions about physical health, suicide, intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and other sensitive conversations. **The COVID-19 pandemic puts in stark relief the potential for chatbots to help save lives.**

    Our project comes handy in such a hard situation. Our project is an all in one tool to know about the information and queries regarding COVID-19. 
  
   Usually we find wrong information from sources or would like to know more information about the current situation or about Covid-19 ,can use our recommendation engine it has information along with links to official websites, if yet their query is not answered they can chat with our bot for more specific information, find out nearest vaccine centres too. They can compare cases of covid with respect to countries. To find this you have to browse different websites and collect data with might not be real time. Hence we have created this recommendation engine to help you find all your queries at one place.
   
   We have some more ideas to enhance this project to next Level , so we are working on it. We would also like to take your opinions and suggestions if any.
